# Sea Level Predictor

This is the boilerplate for the Sea Level Predictor project.

EPA Sea Level Data Analysis
This repository contains Python code to analyze and visualize sea level data provided by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The dataset used is stored in the "epa-sea-level.csv" file.

Features
The code utilizes the following features:

Scatter Plot:

Creates a scatter plot showing the relationship between the year and the CSIRO Adjusted Sea Level.
Lines of Best Fit:

Generates two lines of best fit using linear regression:
The first line represents the overall trend for sea level rise.
The second line represents the trend starting from the year 2000.
Visualizations
The resulting plot includes the scatter plot and both lines of best fit:

Sea Level Plot

Code
The code is written in Python and uses the following libraries:

- pandas
- matplotlib
- scipy

The draw_plot function reads the data, creates the necessary visualizations, and saves the plot as "sea_level_plot.png". You can further explore or modify the code for additional analysis.

Feel free to use this code as a starting point for your sea level data analysis projects.
